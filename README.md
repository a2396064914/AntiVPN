# AntiVPN
A [TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) plugin that aims to prevent VPN connections using [IP Intelligence](https://getipintel.net/)'s API services.

**This plugin isn't intended for public use until I un-hardcode stuff** (is that a term?). If you currently attempt to use it on your own server, I am not responsible for rate limit issues you run into.
